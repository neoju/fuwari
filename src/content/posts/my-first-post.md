### The Spark of an Idea
In my last project, I found myself frequently needing to manipulate JSON data. Whether it was for application's configuration, API testing or data transformation. I usually relied on online JSON tools (like [jsoneditoronline.org](https://jsoneditoronline.org/)) to visualize and edit JSON structures. However, I wanted to create something that useful :) .

Why do I said **something useful**? Because I believe that as a developer, you always want to build something that can help you earn more experience and skills (TODO apps doesn't help, I can tell). But any time that you try to build a thing, you can see that there are many existing tools that can do the same thing. Then you may think **Why should I re-invent the wheel?** and give up your idea. Right? I used to think like that too. But now I have a different perspective. Hopefully, you can get some inspiration from my story.
